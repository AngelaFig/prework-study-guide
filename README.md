# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description

This project serves as a study guide for all students entering a coding bootcamp! As a student myself, I am aware of the fact that the vast amount of new information we must learn may seem overwhelming at times. In building this webpage, I am offering a space for students to refer to throughout their bootcamp when they are in need of clear notes on a variety of important coding topics, such as HTML, Git, Javascript and more! WIth this webpage, one does not have to worry about searching through numerous pages of notes to find answers to their questions.  
	In building this project I have learned the fundamentals of web development and hopefully the notes throughout this webpage will help other new developers to do the same.

## Usage

On this webpage a user will find numerous sections, each covering a specific topic related to web development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. In these sections one will find notes related to the topic that I, a beginner, found especially useful for the development of my web application.  Users can refer to these notes when they have questions and I can continue to update the web application with up to date information as I complete the bootcamp.
