          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>Two elements are especially important in understanding how the structure works:the head and body elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, or metadata, which helps the browser render the webpage correctly.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>CSS is the language used to describe the presentation of a website that is created with HTML.</li>
          <li>CSS is also used to descibe how each element on a webpage is rendered.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside of an element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a free, open source version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Git allows web developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting eachother's work.</li>
          <li>Git allows developers to revert to previous versions of the code if a problem is discovered.</li>
          <li>To access Git, we use the command line and start our command  with "git".</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>Using git commands, we can initiate a repo, add code to our repo, and view the different versions of our code.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your computer, but to collaborate with others you must use a Git-based repository hosting service, such as GitHub.</li>
